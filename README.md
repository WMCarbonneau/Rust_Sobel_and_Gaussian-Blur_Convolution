# Rust_Sobel_and_Gaussian-Blur_Convolution
A simple 3x3 kernel convolution program created in rust using the image crate as a base. This program uses the convolve function to perform gaussian blur and Sobel operations.
Uses a folder called "images" containing a target image called "noise.jpg". This was done for simplicity and prototyping reasons.
